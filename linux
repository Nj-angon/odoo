Ubuntu permission

sudo chmod -R 777 /path/to/directory

Here’s what each part means:

    sudo → Run as superuser.

    chmod → Change permissions.

    -R → Apply changes recursively (to all files and subdirectories).

    777 → Full permissions for owner, group, and others (read, write, execute).

sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/directory
sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory   # Read & execute for others, full for owner
sudo chmod -R 775 /path/to/directory   # Full for owner & group, read/execute for others

sudo systemctl restart service_name   # Restart the service
sudo systemctl enable service_name    # Make it start at boot
sudo systemctl status service_name    # Check its status
